1. What is supervised learning? Provide an example.

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained using labeled data, 
meaning each input is paired with a corresponding output. 
The model learns the relationship between inputs and outputs by minimizing the error 
between its predictions and the actual labels.
Example: In classification, determining whether an email is spam or not based on labeled examples 
of spam and non-spam emails. In regression, predicting house prices using features like area, 
location, and the number of rooms.


2. Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.

Supervised learning:
Uses labeled data with known outputs.
The goal is to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs.
Common tasks: Classification (e.g., identifying email as spam or not) and regression 
(e.g., predicting temperature).
Unsupervised learning:
Works with unlabeled data where outputs are unknown.
The goal is to discover hidden patterns or structures in the data.
Common tasks: Clustering (e.g., grouping customers based on purchasing behavior) and dimensionality reduction 
(e.g., reducing variables for better visualization).
Key difference: The presence (supervised) or absence (unsupervised) of labeled outputs during training.


3. How is reinforcement learning different from supervised learning?

Reinforcement learning:
Involves an agent interacting with an environment, learning by receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.
The objective is to maximize cumulative rewards over time, requiring a balance between exploration 
(trying new actions) and exploitation (using known strategies).
Operates dynamically with feedback rather than predefined labels.
Supervised learning:
Involves static datasets with labeled input-output pairs.
The model is trained to minimize the error between predictions and actual labels.
Key difference: Reinforcement learning focuses on decision-making through trial-and-error feedback, 
while supervised learning uses predefined labels to train a model on static data.
