Robots are intricate systems designed with essential components to tackle complex tasks. 
Their mechanical framework, often inspired by human anatomy, includes joints, links, and 
grippers, granting mobility and precision. A control system processes information to 
direct movements and operations, frequently substituting manual control with autonomous 
programming. Sensors—both internal and external—play a pivotal role in adaptability; 
internal sensors track the robot’s condition, while external sensors gather environmental 
data. Actuators transform electrical energy into mechanical motion, powering the robot's 
physical actions. A power supply sustains these operations, while programming provides 
the precise instructions for task execution, often leveraging sophisticated algorithms 
for accuracy and versatility.
Robots find applications across diverse fields. In industrial automation, they enhance 
productivity and efficiency by executing tasks like assembly, welding, and material 
handling. In healthcare, robots contribute significantly to minimally invasive surgeries, 
rehabilitation therapies, and caregiving, such as meal delivery in hospitals. Exploration 
is another critical domain, where robots are deployed for space missions like Mars Rovers 
and underwater studies, enabling operations in hazardous or unreachable environments. 
These examples underscore robotics' adaptability and transformative potential in 
advancing technology and solving challenges across various sectors.
