This code creates a bar chart to compare the heights and weights of five individuals. 
Each person has two bars: one for their height (in coral) and one for their weight (in purple). 
The bars are positioned side by side for each ID, with a little shift to make them distinct. 
The chart includes labels for the axes, a title, and a grid to make it easier to read. 
A legend helps identify which bar represents height and which represents weight. 
The layout is adjusted to ensure everything fits neatly and is easy to understand.
